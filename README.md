# hote-app

Hotel reservation system using spring boot and thymeleaf.


This project implements a complex domain model powering a session based wizard form flow to book
a hotel room. The flow simulates a real world application in terms of having a variety
of booking options and business rules. 

Key features include

- Thymeleaf ajax fragments + javascript
- Google maps API integration
- Responsive CSS with semantic-ui
- Extensive spring mvc tests + mockito
- Hibernate
- Query DSL

TODO:

I don't have time right now to fix issues that are to do with new thymeleaf versions so you will see these errors.
